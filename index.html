						<h1>Game Development</h1>
						<p>
							Game development is an amazing opportunity to combine so many
							technical disciplines into a single artistic expression. For me,
							there is no greater satisfaction than fully bringing the vision
							of a game to life!
						</p>
						<p>
							Below are some noteworthy game development projects I have
							worked on.
						</p>

						<h2>Repulsor</h2>

								<p>
									For my first publicly released game, <strong>Repulsor</strong>, I challenged myself to build a
									larger game in a short, focused time period by making use of strong up-front planning and time
									management. <br />
									Repulsor is a level-based action game rapidly developed in twelve days.
								</p>
								<h3>High-Speed, Iterative Physics Action</h3>
								<p>
									Repulsor is composed of thirty, very short and frantic levels where the player can only defeat enemies
									by pushing them them into hazards, or vice versa, or enemies into enemies!<br /><br />

									Being a game heavily reliant on physics, the design leans into a very frantic style: the player is
									always moving, enemies are aggressive, and projectiles fly all over the place, and everything dies in
									one hit. <br /><br />

									While Repulsor is very action-y, the extremely fast pace actually makes many gameplay scenarios too
									quick to reliably react to. This interestingly has the effect of requiring the player to plan out
									their route to beating a level ahead of time- eventually building up a strategy which can fully tackle
									the level (However, there is a limited slow-motion slide ability to help line up tricky maneuvers).
								</p>
								<h3>Persistent Data</h3>
								<p>
									This was my first project which made extensive use of persistent data. Levels needed to track high
									scores and the number of points earned per level, as the cumulative point count is used for unlocking
									more levels.<br /><br />

									To store this persistent data, I coded an entire system for serializing level completion data,
									settings, unlocks, and customization. As an added piece, I also figured out how to make beta save
									files backwards compatible!

							</div>
							<div class="content-banner-text">
								<p>
									In learning another engine, Godot (v3.5), I worked on recreating a unique card game designed by game
									developer Tom Scott, <strong>Gridcannon</strong>. <br /><br />

									Card games can be surprisingly tricky to implement for a few reasons! They require a lot of input
									validation, complex state machines to match the many game states, and effects / transitions to guide
									player's attention. Many rules in card games can also be somewhat non-trivial to translate to code.
								</p>
								<p>
									This project also featured a pretty hearty save system which would also double as an undo / buffer
									system. Saving information about where every card needs to go and the game state to a file was an
									interesting challenge to implement, as I wanted reloads to occur smoothly during gameplay without
									creating unnecessarily large files. I eventually managed to save everything in just 624
									bytes!<br /><br />

									This project is unfinished, though I would like to return to it or re-implement it in Godot v4 one
									day.

				<h2>Independent Game Developers Organization (IGDO)</h2>
				<p>
					During my last semester of my masters program, I cofounded my university's game development club! This was an
					awesome opportunity to build a community of game developers for students to join, share their works in, and
					have an avenue to learn game development through.<br /><br />

				</p>
				<div class="content-banner">
					<div class="content-banner-text-reversed">
						<p>
							As the Vice President of the club, I was responsible for community management, creation of club media, and
							creating and giving presentations on game development concepts. I also helped in planning the club's
							activities into the Summer and future semesters.<br /><br />

							During this role, I also got a lot of experience managing open-source repositories during the creation of
							two collaborative projects, setting up project boards and branch protection schemes to ensure members
							could not accidentally make destructive or unfocused changes.

				<h2>Game Developer's Library</h2>
				<p>
					One of the projects I headed in the IGDO was the website <strong>Game Developer's Library
						(GDL)</strong>.<br /><br />

					This site serves as a community-contributed source of video game development information. Any IGDO members
					are given the opportunity to create and add articles, guides, and tutorials about anything related to game
					dev, adding to our repository of knowledge that we can direct new users to. <br /><br />

					The GDL is ran via GitHub pages and a docs framework called MkDocs, meaning that IGDO members can create
					articles on the page in a simple markdown format reviewed via GitHub pull requests. This means that the
					GDL not only serves as a knowledge base, but a low-stress opportunity to learn about open-source workflow-
					one of my favorite aspects of the project.
				<p>
					As part of staging the GDL, I also wrote heaps of articles on it to help out new developers getting into
					game
					development- primarily with Unity. I am very excited to see new contributions, and we already have some
					really interesting articles about Win32 graphics programming from one of our new officers!<br /><br />

					The GDL is a publicly-visible site that anyone can check out! Click the link below to give it a look.

						<h1>Computer Graphics</h1>
						<p>
							I have a particular passion for Computer Graphics, a CS field which employs tons of incredible tricks to
							produce combine artistic design and mathematics into awesome effects!<br /><br />

							The projects labeled "RD" are implemented via a recreation of Dr. Duffin's <em>RD_View</em> rendering
							engine, which itself is heavily based off of Pixar's RenderMan specification. The recreation is written in C++ as
							part of the rendering course via Dr. Duffin's guidance. You can read more about the RD_View render engine
							at the link below.

									The Marching Cubes algorithm is a technique which generates an isosurface from a 3D field of scalar
									values. The isosurface created is a surface which straddles between data points in the field which
									transition across a particular threshold value.<br /><br />

									Marching Cubes was originally developed for and saw much usage in the realm of medical imaging coupled
									with CT and MRI scans. By obtaining a 3D scalar field of densities within a scanned patient, an
									isosurface of particular tissue can be rendered by using the known density of the tissue in question.
									For example, doctors could create a isosurface of the patient's skeletal tissue from the scan to
									observe abnormalities.
								</p>
								<h3>RD_View Implementation</h3>
								The algorithm itself involves evaluating each data point as a voxel whose edges could potentially indicate a threshold-transition across two points in the data. There are 256 possible shapes within each voxel depending on which edges possess a transition! My RD_View
								implementation only covers 180 of the 256 cases (which is why there are "holes" missing in parts of the
								surface), but this is enough to demonstrate the algorithm.

								</p>
								<h4>Smoothing</h4>
								<p>
									In order to increase the smoothness of the created isosurface, trilinear interpolation is used to
									ensure that each voxel's transition points are moved to the exact point of threshold-intersection
									within the data set (rather than at the middle of the voxel edge). This makes the resultant isosurface
									look less 'cubic'.<br /><br />
									Furthermore, the gradient at any given isosurface point was calculated via bilinear interpolation
									across the surface, which can then be applied to the vertex normal to remove jagged edges and create a
									much smoother appearance.<br /><br />

									Both of these smoothing features can be toggled on and off via command line options, as there may be
									some cases where smoothing is undesirable or obfuscates the observable data.

						<h2>Bézier Curves [RD]</h2>
						<div class="content-banner">
							<div class="content-banner-image">
								<img src="images/bezier-flag.gif" />
								<p class="content-banner-image-caption">
									This waving flag is implemented via a textured bezier curve, whose control points are modulated by a
									scrolling sinusoidal function which gets stronger near the end of the flag.<br />
									Some random noise is also applied to the flag to make it look more natural, which is best seen by
									watching how the light scrolls along it (and observing the right-most edge of the flag).
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="content-banner-text">
								<p>
									In graphics, it is often desirable to model curved surfaces which appear remarkably smooth without
									having to explicitly place create thousands of vertices.<br /><br />

									To achieve this, curves are often expressed as mathematical functions between points which are
									modulated via control points. This expression is seen in Bézier, NURBS, and B-Splines
									curves.<br /><br />

									In RD_View, we implement Bézier curves as our curve solution, which allows curves to be rendered and
									modulated via at least three control points. The De Casteljau algorithm is leveraged to perform
									interpolation between the series of control points in order to find vertex positions across the 2D
									curve.<br /><br />

									Further, a 3D <em>Bézier Patch</em> can be created by interpolating between two or more Bézier curves
									spanning the same direction, creating a very smooth, curved surface.

						<h2>Particle Systems: Cannons [RD]</h2>
						<p>
							The animation below demonstrates a dynamic particle system demonstration created via the RD_View engine.
							It presents a scene of cannonballs flying through the air (followed by a motion-trail) and impacting the
							ground in a dramatic explosion of dirt and debris.<br /><br />

							This particle system requires ticking hundreds of small particle elements with physically based movement
							updates each frame, and contains a large number of parameters to customize how their speed and momentum
							should be handled over time. It is worth noting that since RD_View is just a rendering engine, some custom
							physics tick needed to be implemented to handle object transformation over time. <br /><br />

							One interesting thing to note is that all three of the dirt particle groups use the exact same movement
							behavior code, but are parameterized differently to create distinct effects.
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>Dust cloud (White)</strong>: Particles expand in all directions uniformly, and have a high
								velocity dampening so they do not travel very far. Each particle is given a very slightly randomized
								speed to add variance.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Light Debris (Light Brown)</strong>: These particles shoot out in the direction of the
								cannonball's reflection vector upon impact with the ground. A gaussian offset is added to said
								reflection vector (and their speeds) per-particle to create some variance in their motion paths. They have strong
								dampening (not as strong as the cloud), which causes them to suspend in air after the initial burst.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Heavy Debris (Dark Brown)</strong>: These particles are similar to the light debris, but have
								much greater variance and very little dampening, giving them a heavier, more chaotic motion.
							</li>
						</ul>
						</p>
						<div class="centered-container">
							<img class="shadow-image" src="images/rd-cannons-ps.gif">
						</div>
						<br />
						<p>
							The special care for physics simulation here and fine tuning helps create a realistic and interesting
							pattern to these impacts, even just using primitive shapes.<br /><br />
